int main() {
//    magic date is one in which the day multiplied by the month is equal to the last two digits of the year. For example:

//   10/04/1940 is a magic date because 10 * 4 is 40.

//   10/04/2040 is also a magic date because we are only concerned with the last two digits of the year.

 //  Write a program that prompts the user for a date in US numeric format (mm/dd/yyyy), and reports whether or not it is a magic date. The same assumptions and error-checking as in Part 2 also apply here.
    std::cout<< "Please enter a date in US numeric format (mm/dd/yyyy) \n";
